I am a Curious Automation Hacker & Versatile Site Reliability and Big Data Engineer currently living in Lisboa, Portugal. Born in the Netherlands and raised with the traits and benefits of a multicultural education, which made me a very inquisitive Computer Science Engineer and a technology enthusiast.

My professional interests range from SRE, Monitoring, Analytics, Automation, Big Data, Distributed System to Datahub and Microservice Platform Architectures, including the many tools and programming languages that are related to it (i.e. Docker, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Python, Node.JS, Java, Go, etc.). Casually, I also like reading about other innovation-related subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain and of course the latest Startups.
